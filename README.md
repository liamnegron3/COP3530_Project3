# COP3530_Project3
Final Project for Data Structures and Algorithms


This project is an efficient program for categorizing and searching through hundreds of thousands of organisms based on their unique characteristics, such as scientific and common names, ancestry, and relatedness with other species.

The project includes five options a user can choose from, which are displaying a species ancestry tree, finding a common ancestor between two specified species, finding the shortest path between two specified species, displaying species that are related to the specified species and a list of ten animals that are closely related to the two specified species.

The data set containing the scientific and common names of organisms can be found at this link: https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/download.

To run the application easily you can download the qt creator ide.
